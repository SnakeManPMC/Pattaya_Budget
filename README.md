# Pattaya_Budget

Quick calculation tool for average Pattaya holiday budget.

Priceless (no pun intended) tool to calculate those holiday budgets.

You can set currency exchange rate, existing funds and airline ticket prices as base. Then input various daily expenses according to your habits, do you take baht buss or motorbike taxi? How much alcohol do you use (bar expenses)? etc it all is very easy to change with the dialog. Finally just click update and see the results.

Returns holiday budget sum in euro and thai baht, as well as months to save money before this sum is achieved.
